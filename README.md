# messageEncode

## Summary
Hide secret messages in plain sight. This is a fun little exersize in reversing a cypher. This code was never intended for anything other than a fun challenge to present to friends. Can you find the hidden message without looking at the code or spoiler?

### Sample encoded message

Hey,  boy,  can you change into a green cube? " Archie asked.  The purple sphere regarded him sadly. "Ed,  throw me that old canteen.  " The canteen was thrown down. "Now look, boy. " He carefully drew a circle and a square in the sand. "See this?  This is a sphere.  That's you, get it? " He pointed to the circle, then to the purple sphere. "This is a cube, see? " He indicated the square. "Now,  we want you to change into a cube;  get it? A green cube.  " The purple sphere blinked its great eyes and continued to stare at Archie sadly.  "We ought to shoot it. Maybe it's got some playmates around here.  Archie,  you got no business petting big purple balls.Remember what happened when you started fooling around with that orange thing back on LTX-R-76--whatever it was?
